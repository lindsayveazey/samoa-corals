    "I think it's most appropriate to build models for each coral group for *all* islands. I'm looking to predict out to grids that have not been sampled for some of the coral groups in some regions; I don't think conditions will vary so dramatically between islands that island-specific models will offer anything beyond what group-sprecific all-island models offer.\n",

    "For the models, I'm using group-level data from the following islands:\n",
