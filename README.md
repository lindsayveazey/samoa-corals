# samoa_corals

This repository is a work in progress and will include primarily Jupyter Notebooks using R and Python. Raw data may be included at some point.

- data_wrangling.ipynb (R): organizing, importing, cleaning raw data. *Completed raw data cleaning*

- spatial_models.ipynb (R): checking for correlations, outliers, and missing data; imputing/removing data as needed; running various models to predict occurrence/abundance of different coral groups per region
