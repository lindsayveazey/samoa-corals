# samoa_corals

This repository is a work in progress and will include primarily Jupyter Notebooks using R and Python. Raw data may be included at some point.

- data_wrangling.ipynb (R): organizing, importing, cleaning raw data. *Completed raw data cleaning*

- spatial_model_setup.ipynb (R): checking for correlations, outliers, and missing data; imputing/removing data as needed

- classifier_models (Python): running various classifier models to predict occurrence of different coral groups per region

- abundance_models (Python): running various regressor models to predict abundance of different coral groups per region
